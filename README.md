# Portfolio
A site that displays Matt Thurber's professional work. 

Within the header, users can click the links to get to different sections of the page. You can see an actual recent picture of Matt, with the "about me" bio of Matt Thurber right below. The "work" section of the page consists of different projects I have completed. Currently, I have placeholders that I will modify later in the course. In the next section "contact me" users can see all the key information to reach out to me personally. Finally, I have attached a link to view my resume.
